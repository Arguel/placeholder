# pokemon-ecommerce-clone

A mini e-commerce made mainly with react

Deployment: [https://pokemon-ecommerce-clone.vercel.app/](https://pokemon-ecommerce-clone.vercel.app/)

Inspired by the [official pokemon site](https://www.pokemon.com/el/) (Spanish version) (Project for educational purposes only!!!)

Some modifications were made to it to fulfill the purpose of being an e-commerce, it is not identical, but several classes of the original are used

The most current changes are in the [develop branch](https://github.com/Arguel/pokemon-ecommerce-clone/tree/develop), the responsive design still needs to be done
